    <p>I have read the related LOA policy and may be LOA more than 5 months. Currently I am taking my summer course CS570 which end on August 9, so I plan to leave US in August after the summer semester ends. LOA policy requires to submit the LOA to OIS before the add/drop date of Fall 2022, which is 2022 September 9. Also. I should leave US within 15 days of the above-mentioned LOA start date. My plan and important days are as following.</p>
